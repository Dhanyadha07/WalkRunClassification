# Walk-Run Prediction 🚶‍♂️🏃‍♂️

This project implements a **Walk-Run Prediction** system using **Machine Learning**. It leverages **sensor data** and a **classification model** to accurately differentiate between walking and running activities.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to classify human activities based on motion data using machine learning techniques. The key steps involved are:
- Preprocessing sensor data
- Building and training a classification model
- Evaluating the model’s performance on test data
- Deploying the model for real-world activity recognition

## 🚀 Features
✅ Utilizes **sensor-based dataset** for training and testing  
✅ Implements **ML classification algorithms** for accurate predictions  
✅ Achieves **high accuracy** in walk-run differentiation  
✅ Supports **real-time predictions** for user activity  
✅ Provides a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for easy interaction  

## 👨‍💻 Usage
To use the real-time activity recognition system, follow these steps:
1. Run the `walkrun.ipynb` file.
2. Run `app.py` to open the graphical interface (in bash, run `streamlit run app.py`).
3. Upload motion sensor data or stream live sensor readings.
4. The system will process the data and predict whether the activity is walking or running.
